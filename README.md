# Dark-Theme-Employee-Payroll

Software that allows Admins to keep track of employee attendance and payroll.

They can search for an employee, add employee, edit employee details, set status as active/inactive, check the salary details and breakdown of the salary of each employee by entering the employee ID and date.
