    This is software that allows admins to keep track of employee attendance and payroll.
    Admins can create employee profiles for each employee by entering relevant personal
    information (name, job position, qualification, etc.). They can search for an employee,
    add employee, edit employee details, set status as active/inactive, check the salary
    details and breakdown of the salary of each employee by entering the employee ID and date.

This application holds information on {{ user_count }} employees, and {{ paystub_count }} paystubs.
